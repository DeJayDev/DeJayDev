# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Dj

I am a `23.653` year old Software Engineer and Community Manager from Chicago, Illinois. 

Currently I am a (the!) Community Engineer at [Runpod](https://runpod.io?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=djwashere)!

When I'm not working I enjoy traveling, taking photos, singing songs, and spending time with my favorite people. 

I use these often:
